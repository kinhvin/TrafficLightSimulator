# TrafficLightSimulator
A traffic light simulator I made back in grade 11 (2021 - 2022) for my computer engineering class. It features the standard traffic light sequence, pedestrian signals and railway crossing signals. Unfortunately the code for this has been long lost but provided in this repo is the video I made for it.
