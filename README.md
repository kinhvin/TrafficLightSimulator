# Description
A traffic light simulator I made back in grade 11 (2021 - 2022) for my computer engineering class. It features the standard traffic light sequence, pedestrian signals and railway crossing signals. It was programmed in MPLABX with C using a PIC microcontroller. Unfortunately the code for this has been long lost, but the provided YouTube link is a showcase of this project: https://youtu.be/xgEXKS9g9A4?si=kAJILWzVAm6jdyQC
